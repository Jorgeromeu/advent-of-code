# Day 12

I did bfs to get all of the paths from `start` to `end`. Then it is just a question of changing the definition of what is a "visited node" so that we can visit some nodes twice. For part 1 this was a very simple change, it was just defining it so that if the node is capitalized it is never "visited". For the part two I did the same thing but with a more complex rule set for what is a visited node.
