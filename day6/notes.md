- each fish creates a new one every 7 days
- newborn lanternfish require 2 days before starting their first cycle

- start at 3:
- +1 -> 2
- +1 -> 1
- +1 -> 0
- +1 -> 6, new lanternfish with interval 8 is born
- +1 -> first has 6, second has 7

- each day, 0 becomes a 6 and adds 8 to end of list  all other nums decrease by 1
- return amount of fish after 80 days

fav problem so far!
